FlashFit is simple jquery and super light plugin developed to fit liquid flash sites. When developing flash sites, sometimes it is needed to make it 100% wide and high, but also maintain minimum dimensions, so if the window is reduced below the minimum size, scrollbars will appear.

Its usage is as easy as:

<div id="flashcontent"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
(function($){
	$('#flashcontent').flashfit({
		minWidth: 960,
		minHeight: 500
	});

	swfobject.embedSWF("demo.swf", "flashcontent", "100%", "100%", "10.0.0");
})(window.jQuery);
</script>

One important thing is to apply flashfit before applying swfobject on a div. You should do so, because swfobject replaces the div with its own markup, so you cannot access it through simple jquery selector.

If you want more features, try swffit available at http://swffit.millermedeiros.com/ - it's really great library, but more than 4 times bigger (4.2 KB) than flashfit (0.82 KB minified). You choose what you need ;)

Oh, and I forget to mention, that it's fresh library that may be buggy just a little bit ;)

good luck,
